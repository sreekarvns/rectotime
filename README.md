- **Premium Colors**: Deep blues, soft grays, vibrant accents
- **Generous Spacing**: Breathing room between all elements
- **Micro-interactions**: Every interaction feels premium

## 🔧 Configuration

### Customizing Productive/Distraction Domains

Edit `src/utils/activityMonitor.ts` to add or modify domain categories:

const PRODUCTIVE_DOMAINS = [
  'leetcode.com',
  'github.com',
  // Add your domains
];

const DISTRACTION_DOMAINS = [
  'youtube.com',
  'twitter.com',
  // Add your domains
];
```

### AI Guidance Rules

Customize AI suggestions in `src/utils/aiGuidance.ts`:
