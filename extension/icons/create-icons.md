# Creating Extension Icons

The Chrome extension needs three icon sizes. You can create them using any image editor or online tool.

## Required Sizes
- **icon16.png**: 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- **icon48.png**: 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- **icon128.png**: 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Quick Options

### Option 1: Use an Online Tool
1. Go to https://www.favicon-generator.org/ or similar
2. Upload a logo/image
3. Download the generated icons
4. Rename and place in this folder

### Option 2: Create Simple Icons
You can create simple colored squares with text using any image editor:
- Use a gradient background (blue to purple)
- Add "PO" or "OS" text in white
- Export at the three required sizes

### Option 3: Use Default (Temporary)
The extension will work without icons - Chrome will show a default placeholder. You can add icons later.

## Icon Design Suggestions
- Use the same color scheme as the dashboard (blues, purples)
- Keep it simple and recognizable
- Consider using a productivity-related symbol (target, checkmark, etc.)
